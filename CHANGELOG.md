# 1.25.0 (02/18/2016)

## Features

 - Image Widget: added a new Widget for displaying images.

 - YouTube Widget: added a new Widget for displaying YouTube videos.

 - Data Source Broadcasting: rewrote all Data Sources and Widgets to communicate using global events.  This resolves memory leaks and performance degredation due to unremoved callbacks.

 - Improved logging, and added a configurable property to enable debug logging (globally)

## Bug Fixes

 - Removed unique constraint on email field for Users

## Breaking Changes

 - The Data Source api method 'getData()' has been deprecated.  Any custom Widgets should be rewritten to follow the new event-based messaging pattern.  Any custom Data Sources which use the Data Source Factory (recommended) will automatically use the new pattern.

# 1.24.0 (02/04/2016)

## Features

 - Scrolling Dashboards: Dashboards now automatically scroll if the Widgets on a page exceed the size of the browser.  If the Widgets on a page fit without overflowing, the Dashboard will appear as before without any scrollbars.  This replaces the previous behavior of fitting the page to the browser window, and hiding any overflowing content.

 - Likes: Added the ability for logged-in users to like (and unlike) dashboards.  Users can search for dashboards they liked, or sort search results by the number of likes

 - Sortable Search Results: The Dashboard Search results can be sorted using various keys such as Name, Tags, Visits, Likes, etc.

 - Advanced Search Filters: Dashboards can be searched using several new search filters: "is:deleted", "include:deleted", "likedby:<user>", "lastupdatedby:<user>".
